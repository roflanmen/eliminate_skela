Hi
If you're reading this, then you're somehow related to KH-214.

Right here there is some python code to spam message reactions in telegram.

Now that you've got such power, you have to use it properly.

Follow the instructions to eliminate our target(skela):

Go to https://my.telegram.org/apps

Log in and create your telegram app

Copy api_id and api_hash and paste into your code

Open your terminal and install some packages:

Windows:
pip install pyrogram
pip install asyncio

Linux users(user) are smart enough to install by themselves

Now, after you've pasted api_id and api_hash, run your code and login

You've successfully started liquidating skela
